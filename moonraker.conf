[update_manager extension_name]
type: git_repo
#   Currently must be git_repo.  This value is set depending on how an
#   extension chooses to deploy updates, see its documentation for details.
#   This parameter must be provided.
channel: dev
#   The update channel.  The available value differs depending on the
#   "type" option.
#      type: git_repo - May be dev or beta.  The dev channel will update to
#                       the latest pushed commit, whereas the beta channel
#                       will update to the latest tagged commit.
#   The default is dev.
path: https://github.com/e-dreyer/Crealit-K1-Config
#   The absolute path to the client's files on disk. This parameter must be
#   provided.
#   Example:
#     path: ~/service_name
origin:
#   The full git URL of the "origin" remote for the repository.  This can
#   be be viewed by navigating to your repository and running:
#     git remote -v
#   This parameter must be provided.
primary_branch:
#   The name of the primary branch used for release code on this repo.  This
#   option allows clients to specify 'main', or their own unique name, as
#   the branch used for repo validity checks.  The default is master.
virtualenv:
#   An optional path to the virtualenv folder for Python Applications. For
#   example, Moonraker's default virtualenv is located at ~/moonraker-env.
#   When a virtualenv is specified Moonraker can update its Python
#   dependencies when it detects a change to the requirements file.  The
#   default is no virtualenv.
env:
#   *** DEPRICATED FOR NEW CONFIGURATIONS - USE the 'virtualenv' OPTION ***
#
#   The path to the extension's virtual environment executable on disk.  For
#   example, Moonraker's venv is located at ~/moonraker-env/bin/python.
#   The default is no env, which disables updating python packages.
requirements:
#  This is the location in the repository to the extension's python
#  requirements file. This location is relative to the root of the repository.
#  This parameter must be provided if the 'virtualenv' or 'env' option is set,
#  otherwise it must be omitted.
system_dependencies:
#  A path, relative to the repository, to a json file containing operating
#  system package dependencies.  Application developers should refer to the
#  "System Dependencies File Format" section of this document for details on how
#  this file should be formatted. The default is no system dependencies.
install_script:
#  *** DEPRICATED FOR NEW CONFIGURATIONS - USE the 'system_dependencies' OPTION ***
#
#  The file location, relative to the repository, for the installation script
#  associated with this application.  Moonraker will not run this script, instead
#  it will parse the script searching for new "system" package dependencies that
#  require installation.  Packages in the script must be defined as follows for
#  Moonraker to successfully parse them:
#      PKGLIST="packagename1 packagename2 packagename3"
#      PKGLIST="${PKGLIST} packagename4 packagename5"
#
#  Note that the "packagenameX" items in the example above should be the names
#  of valid system packages.  The second line in the example is optional and
#  additional lines in the same format may be added.
#
#  The default is no install script.
enable_node_updates:
#   When set to True, Moonraker will assume that this repo relies upon node
#   and will attempt to execute "npm ci --only=prod" when it detects a change
#   to package-lock.json.  Note that if your project does not have a
#   package-lock.json in its root directory then the plugin will fail to load.
#   Default is False.
is_system_service: True
#   This should be set to False for repos that are not installed as a service
#   or do not need to restart a service after updates. This option sets the
#   default value for the "managed_services" option.  When set to False,
#   "managed_services" defaults to an empty list.  When set to True,
#   "managed_services" defaults to a list containing a single item, a service
#   matching the "extension_name" provided in the section header. The default
#   is True.
#   NOTE: In the future this option will be deprecated.  In preparation
#   for this, extensions that are installed as service, such as "KlipperScreen"
#   should ignore this option and set the "managed_services" option.
managed_services:
#   A list of one or more systemd services that must be restarted after an
#   update is complete.  Multiple services must be separated by whitespace.
#   Currently this option is restricted to the following values:
#       <name>    - The name configured in the extension's section header.
#                   If the section header is [update_manager KlipperScreen]
#                   then KlipperScreen would be a valid value.
#       klipper   - The Klipper service associated with this instance of
#                   Moonraker will be restarted after an update.
#       moonraker - The Moonraker service will be restarted after an update.
#
#   NOTE: Moonraker will resolve the service names for the "klipper" and
#   "moonraker" services if they are not the default values.  Specific names
#   such as "klipper-1" or "moonraker_2" should not be entered in this option.
#
#   When this option is specified it overrides the "is_system_service" option.
#   Thus it is not required to specify both, only one or the other.  The
#   default is no managed services if "is_system_service" is set to False,
#   otherwise the default is the service named in the section header.
refresh_interval:
#   This overrides the refresh_interval set in the primary [update_manager]
#   section.
info_tags:
#   Optional information tags about this application that will be reported
#   front-ends as a list of strings. Each tag should be separated by a new line.
#   For example:
#       info_tags:
#           desc=Special Application
#   Front-ends my use these tags to perform additional actions or display
#   information, see your extension documentation for details on configuration.
#   The default is an empty list.
